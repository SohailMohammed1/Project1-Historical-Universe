            <p class="center">
                There was nothing. An empty void of Space and Time where nothing could exist. 
                This changed completely once the Big Bang occured. 13.7 billion years ago,
                the Universe was subjected to an outward explosion that lasted, according to Scientists, around "billionth
                of a billionth of a billionth of a billionth of a second". In that moment, the Universe was the size of a grapefruit. 
                <br>
                The Large Hadron Collider, located in Geneva, Switzerland, is currently investigating the conditions of 
                the Universe after the 1st second has passed since the Big Bang. So far, we know that that it took up to 100-
                1000 seconds for the first nuclei of Hydrogen, Helium and other gas elements to form. Using other equipment, 
                we can also investigate the earliest radiation stemming from the Big Bang. It is stated that before this time,
                the Universe could not be detected due to its rapidly expanding nature.

            <h3 class="hcenter">Blast from the Past...</h3>
            <p class="center">
                Over the years of research conducted by many Astrophysicists and Scientists alike, we can gather
                that matter started to clump together underneath its own gravity around a couple hundred million years after and this formed, what are known as,
                the first ever 'Protogalaxies' which contained the earliest Stars. The Stars themselves are massive clumps of
                of Carbon, Oxygen, Silicon, and Iron.  
                <br>
                Once a few billion years had passed, the acceleration of the Universe began to slow down. This caused
                a phenomena of curiosity due to the fact that a certain force, called 'Dark Energy', was the drive behind 
                the acceleration in the first place. The nature of dark energy is still unknown, to this day. 
                <br>
                Nine to ten billion years ago, the universe gave birth to the Sun as well as all the planets in the 
                Solar System. Along with this came all of the Astroids and comets situated within the Kuiper Belt. These objects
                were all remenants of earlier generations of stars. After another billion years, humans began to appear on Earth and
                Scientists suspect that life couldve began from stray comets and astroids containing organic matter.

            <h3 class="hcenter">To the Present...</h3>
            <p class="center">
                13.7 billion years ago the Universe took its first breath of life and gave rise to all of the galaxies, planets and stars
                as well as all the other objects we observe within the night sky. Today we study, explore and expand our own curious
                minds over the behaviour and mysterious nature of the Universe. We sit and ask ourselves what other phenomena the Universe has in store for us
                as well as observing its current state.
            </p>
            <h3 class="hcenter">The Future...</h3>
            <p class="center">
                In around 20 billion years, the Sun's outer layers will expand and turn into a 'Red Giant'. Essentially,
                it will turn into a super massive version of itself and wipe all life on earth. 
                <br>
                In a Googol years (thats 10(100) years!) all life in the Universe will seize to exist due to a certain event 
                known as the 'Deep Freeze'. This event indicates that the Universe will lose all of its heat as the final stars 
                die out and nothing continues to live. Every proton will decay and every Black Hole will evaporate and the Universe will, once again,
                go back to the cold, empty space that it once was.
