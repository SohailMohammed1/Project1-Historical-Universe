# Motivation behind website

This website offers a brief account of the History of the Universe. Although it does not go into much detail, the aim was to create an impactful and responsive webpage that would allow users to learn a bit more about Space and its creation. This website includes an image gallery that would allow users to marvel at some of the wonders of The Universe and gain more of an appreciation for its existence.

# What did I learn?

During the process, I learnt a lot about the relationship between HTML and CSS. A lot of hours went into troubleshooting due to the fact that very slight mistakes were made which would impact the entire website. This ranged from the sizes of the borders on the homepage, all the way to the footer of the contact webpage. 

# Features

## Header

The header serves as a main point of return to the original homepage of the Historical Universe website

## Navigation Bar

The Nav Bar allows the Users to move between the three webpages: Home, Gallery and Contact. 

## Footer

The footer allows users to access any of the 4 social media websites belonging to Historical Universe

## Context

The context, as mentioned before, was intended to inform and educate the users on the history of the Universe. The borders would clearly indicate the timeline of events and help break up the chunks of content. 



## Gallery

The gallery was implimented in order for the users to be able to see some of the fascinating images of Space that would coerce them into learning more and gain a higher level of appreciation. When clicked on, the images would take the users to a seperate webpage where they could see them in much higher resolution. 

## Contact Form

The contact form was implemented so that users could submit inqueries and offer suggestions as to what other content could be added to website. 

# Testing

### W3C - no major errors although the use of varying sized headings was suggested
CSS Jigsaw Validator - No errors found

## Fixing bugs

Although the above testing seems to indicate that the website is has no major flaws, when testing initially, the website would not display features such as footer and resizing images so that they could pass through the responsive criteria took a lot of time. To combat this issue, I set up a call with my tutor who was able to guide me through the use of media inqueries along with a lot of troubleshooting so that the footer would appear on the final webpage. 

The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows:
In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab
From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch
Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.

## Deployment

The site was deployed and hosted on GitHub pages. By navigating to the repository settings and then clicking pages, I was able to select the Master Branch option from the source section dropdown menu. This would then allow a link to appear and the deployment would be a success.
