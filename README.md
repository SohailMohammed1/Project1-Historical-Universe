# Motivation behind website

This website offers a brief account of the History of the Universe. Although it does not go into much detail, the aim was to create an impactful and responsive webpage that would allow users to learn a bit more about Space and its creation. This website includes an image gallery that would allow users to marvel at some of the wonders of The Universe and gain more of an appreciation for its existence.

# What did I learn?

During the process, I learnt a lot about the relationship between HTML and CSS. A lot of hours went into troubleshooting due to the fact that very slight mistakes were made which would impact the entire website. This ranged from the sizes of the borders on the homepage, all the way to the footer of the contact webpage. 

# Features

## Header

The header serves as a main point of return to the original homepage of the Historical Universe website

## Navigation Bar

The Nav Bar allows the Users to move between the three webpages: Home, Gallery and Contact. 

## Footer

The footer allows users to access any of the 4 social media websites belonging to Historical Universe

## Context

The context, as mentioned before, was intended to inform and educate the users on the history of the Universe. The borders would clearly indicate the timeline of events and help break up the chunks of content. 

## Gallery

The gallery was implimented in order for the users to be able to see some of the fascinating images of Space that would coerce them into learning more and gain a higher level of appreciation. When clicked on, the images would take the users to a seperate webpage where they could see them in much higher resolution.
